    <h1>My project</h1>
    <div id="description">When considering the textual encoding for these files, one of the main things I wanted to showcase was the physicality of the documents on the page.
    I think that when it comes to the digital, people have become used to looking at text in particular ways, from the formation of physical letters on a screen, to the assurance
    of clean, unblemished understanding, and these documents aren't like that at all. The fact that there was a number of physical distortions, from inkblots to paragraph division
    and letter splitting all served to really highlight the articles as a form of media that demands effort. Newspapers are a tangible media, with a physicality that underscores
    the validity of the words printed on them, and similiarly when I was looking at the text itself, both of the subjects and the viewpoints they took, struck me as particularly
    interesting. The first, a kind of pre-historic "All Lives Matter" argument, was curious, in that the author clearly identifies the issues with racial dividing and profiling...
    while seeking to do just that through her passionate retort of racial intolerance on the campus. Much like the arguments of Black Lives Matter activists today, the author
    refuses to acknowledge the individual struggles of blackness itself, witnessing the transgressions of White America, but giving it a pass, as the atonement for past sins
    comes at a lesser price than accountability. In contrast, the article on black difficulties in dentistry, see black issues in America and create a parallel vision of opportunity
    almost separating the reality from the understanding of why so few black doctors exist. What stands out to me in this piece and what I wanted to bring a particular focus on through
    my encoding, was the use of numbers as a particular focus point in an attempt to make people understanding the severity of the issue. The way the article is written, the numbers serve as a kind of focal point to this idea that the sitatuion doesn't seem to be as bad mainstream America seems to believe. Perhaps, the black community knew very well
    what was happening, but the average white person of the time didn't understand or believe the idea that so few black dentists could practice. I also made a conscious decision to
    uppercase every instance of "Black" in the piece as a show of respect to the people that were being talked about. I feel that there is a concrete difference between the idea of the
    darkest color, and the labeling of a racial group, and in this piece, I wanted to make sure to highlight the difference as a sort inferiority complex played out. I also made note
    of the fact that only men were mentioned in the piece as the representatives of future doctors, while women remained outside, and I see that this too, is an idea of the time.
    In reality, The articles paint a startling vision of Maryland in the 60's. It was a time where inequality was made visible, but total reconcilliation seemed then as it does now, overwhelming as instead, a kind of
    incremental understanding worked its way into the consciousness of the people in the area. Textual encoding helps to understand the physicality of the media of the time, and through
    it, one side of understanding of what remains to this day, a difficult issue.</div>
